# Timer test task boilerplate

This is a boilerplate project for the timer test task. You can add any additional dependencies you need, including style libraries etc, but you should use [Fluent UI](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui) for the UI and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for the state management.

Project structure is up to you.

To run the backend, use `docker run -p 7654:7654 -d strander/timer-api`. The backend will be available at `http://localhost:7654`.
Refer to the [backend README](BACKEND.md) for more information.
